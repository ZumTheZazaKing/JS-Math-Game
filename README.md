# JS-Math-Game
a math game I coded with JavaScript

it doesn't have much questions though

and the answers for the questions might only be known by programmers

either way, feel free to add more questions if you want

I only put in two because I wasn't really bothered with adding more questions

maybe, I should've done three.

Meh, two is fine

I played around with arrays to make this by the way

anyways,

you can edit the code and request a pull from me
